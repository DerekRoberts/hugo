# Welcome to the New Metacurious Site!

We're excited to announce that Metacurious has been successfully migrated from Wix to Hugo with GitHub Pages hosting!

## Why Hugo?

Hugo is a fast, modern static site generator that offers several advantages:

- **Speed**: Hugo is incredibly fast at building sites
- **Simplicity**: Content is written in Markdown, making it easy to write and maintain
- **Flexibility**: Extensive theming and customization options
- **Version Control**: All content is tracked with Git
- **Free Hosting**: GitHub Pages provides reliable, free hosting

## What's Next?

We'll be gradually migrating content from the old Wix site and adding new features. Stay tuned for updates!

Thank you for visiting Metacurious!
